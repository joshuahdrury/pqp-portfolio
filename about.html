        I am an educator and school leader with experience spanning classroom instruction, curriculum development, 
        professional learning communities, and school administration. My professional journey has been shaped by a 
        strong commitment to collaborative leadership, instructional improvement, and student-centered learning.

        I currently serve as a General Studies Teacher at Bialik Hebrew Day School and previously held the role of 
        Vice-Principal during the 2020–2021 school year. In these roles, I have supported staff development, curriculum 
        implementation, professional learning initiatives, and the creation of inclusive learning environments that 
        prioritize student well-being and academic growth.

        Beyond the school setting, I bring leadership experience from program development and system-level roles in 
        sport and community organizations. These experiences strengthened my ability to lead teams, manage complex 
        initiatives, and build sustainable programs aligned with shared goals.

        Outside of my professional work, I am a proud father of two children and value spending time with my family. 
        I enjoy hiking and rock climbing as ways to promote both physical and mental well-being, resilience, and balance 
        — principles that also inform my leadership practice.
