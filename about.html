  <p>
    I am an educator and school leader with experience spanning classroom instruction, curriculum development, 
    professional learning communities, and school administration. My professional journey has been shaped by 
    a strong commitment to collaborative leadership, instructional improvement, and student-centered learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently serve as a General Studies Teacher at Bialik Hebrew Day School and previously held the role of 
    Vice-Principal during the 2020–2021 school year. In these roles, I have supported staff development, curriculum 
    implementation, professional learning initiatives, and the creation of inclusive learning environments that 
    prioritize student well-being and academic growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond the school setting, I bring leadership experience from program development and system-level roles in 
    sport and community organizations. These experiences have strengthened my ability to lead teams, manage 
    complex initiatives, and build sustainable programs aligned with shared goals and values.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am passionate about fostering cultures of collaboration, collective efficacy, and continuous improvement. 
    I believe effective leadership is grounded in relationship-building, reflective practice, and empowering 
    others to take ownership of their professional growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of my professional work, I am a proud father of two children and value spending time with my family. 
    I enjoy hiking and rock climbing as ways to promote both physical and mental well-being. These activities 
    reinforce resilience, balance, and perseverance; qualities that also inform my leadership and educational practice.
