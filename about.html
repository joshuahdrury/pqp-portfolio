      <p>
        I am an educator and school leader with experience spanning classroom instruction, curriculum development, 
        professional learning communities, and school administration. My professional journey has been shaped by a 
        strong commitment to collaborative leadership, instructional improvement, and student-centered learning.

        I currently serve as a General Studies Teacher at Bialik Hebrew Day School and previously held the role of 
        Vice-Principal during the 2020–2021 school year. In these roles, I have supported staff development, curriculum 
        implementation, professional learning initiatives, and the creation of inclusive learning environments that 
        prioritize student well-being and academic growth.

        Beyond the school setting, I bring extensive leadership experience from program development, organizational 
        management, and system-level roles in sport and community organizations. These experiences have strengthened 
        my ability to lead teams, manage complex initiatives, and build sustainable programs that align with shared 
        goals and values.

        I am passionate about fostering cultures of collaboration, collective efficacy, and continuous improvement. 
        I believe effective leadership is grounded in relationship-building, reflective practice, and empowering 
        others to take ownership of their professional growth.

        Outside of my professional work, I am a proud father of two children and value spending quality time with my family. 
        I enjoy hiking and rock climbing, which I view as important practices for maintaining both physical and mental 
        well-being. These activities reinforce the importance of resilience, balance, and goal-setting — principles that 
        also inform my leadership and educational practice.
