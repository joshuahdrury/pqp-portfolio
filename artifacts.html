<summary>Artifact 1: PLC Leadership – Math Curriculum & Coding</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p><strong>Evidence</strong><br>
Led a Professional Learning Community to revise the mathematics curriculum to include coding.
Supported staff through initial hesitation by modelling lessons, co-learning, and guided
instruction using slideshows and hands-on learning opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong><br>
Reflection Response

My leadership responded to staff hesitation by prioritizing psychological safety, gradual skill-building, and shared ownership of learning. 
I acknowledged that coding was unfamiliar and potentially intimidating for some staff, which helped normalize discomfort and reduce resistance. 
Rather than positioning myself as the sole expert, I adopted a co-learning approach that emphasized growth, experimentation, and professional risk-taking. 
This helped shift the mindset from “mastery first” to “learning in progress,” aligning with a culture of continuous improvement.

The strategies that most effectively built confidence and collective efficacy included modelling classroom-ready lessons, providing scaffolded instructional resources (such as step-by-step slideshows and guided activities), and facilitating hands-on collaborative practice during PLC sessions. 
Teachers were able to immediately experience success as learners before transferring strategies into their own classrooms. Peer sharing of small wins further strengthened collective efficacy, as staff began to see the impact on student engagement and problem-solving skills. 
Over time, this approach fostered increased instructional risk-taking, stronger collaboration, and greater staff ownership of the revised mathematics curriculum.


<p><strong>Impact</strong><br>
Teachers developed confidence with coding concepts and embedded them into curriculum planning and lesson instruction.</p>

<p><strong>Reflection</strong><br>
The unit plans and assessments produced through the PLC process highlight a shift toward shared ownership of curriculum and instructional practice. Teachers were actively involved in co-constructing learning goals, success criteria, and assessment approaches, which fostered a sense of collective responsibility for student learning. The alignment across units indicates that instructional decisions were grounded in shared understanding rather than individual preference. As a leader, this reinforced the importance of creating structures that support collaboration, reduce variability in instruction, and promote equitable learning experiences for students.</p>

<p><strong>Impact</strong><br>
Increased instructional coherence across grades.</p>
